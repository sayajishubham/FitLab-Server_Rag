FAT LOSS SCIENCE PRINCIPLES

Fat loss occurs when calorie expenditure exceeds calorie intake over time.

Safe Deficit:
300-500 kcal per day deficit is sustainable.

Muscle Preservation:
- High protein intake (2g/kg)
- Resistance training mandatory
- Adequate sleep

Cardio Role:
Cardio increases energy expenditure but should not replace resistance training.

Metabolic Adaptation:
Prolonged dieting may reduce metabolic rate slightly.

Indian Diet Strategy:
- High fiber vegetables
- Controlled rice portions
- Adequate protein at each meal
- Avoid liquid calories
