INDIAN VEGETARIAN PROTEIN SOURCES

Vegetarian diets in India rely heavily on legumes and dairy.

Protein Sources:
- Paneer
- Curd
- Milk
- Dal (lentils)
- Chickpeas
- Rajma
- Soya chunks

Protein Quality:
Plant proteins may lack one or more essential amino acids. Combining cereals (rice, roti) with legumes improves amino acid completeness.

Leucine Threshold:
To maximize muscle protein synthesis, approximately 2-3g leucine per meal is beneficial. Paneer and soy are higher quality vegetarian sources.

Daily Protein Recommendation:
1.6-2g per kg bodyweight for active individuals.

Calorie Consideration:
Vegetarian protein sources often include carbohydrates; macro balance must be calculated carefully.
