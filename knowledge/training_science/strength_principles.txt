STRENGTH TRAINING PRINCIPLES

Strength training is primarily focused on increasing maximal force production. The main adaptation occurs at the neurological level before significant muscle size increases occur.

Key Physiological Adaptations:
- Increased motor unit recruitment
- Improved synchronization of motor units
- Enhanced rate coding
- Reduced inhibitory reflexes
- Increased myofibrillar density

Rep Ranges and Intensity:
Strength adaptations occur best in the 1-6 rep range at intensities of 75-95% of one-repetition maximum (1RM). Lower repetitions allow higher mechanical tension and neural drive.

Rest Intervals:
Long rest periods (2-5 minutes) are critical to restore ATP-PC energy systems and maintain performance output across sets.

Primary Movement Patterns:
- Squat (knee-dominant)
- Hinge (deadlift patterns)
- Horizontal press
- Vertical press
- Horizontal pull
- Vertical pull

Progressive Overload:
Strength development requires systematic overload. This can be achieved through:
- Increasing load
- Increasing sets
- Increasing frequency
- Reducing rest strategically
- Periodization cycles (4-12 weeks)

Volume Consideration:
Strength training uses lower total volume compared to hypertrophy training but higher intensity per set.

Energy System:
Primary energy system involved is ATP-PC (phosphagen system), dominant in efforts under 10 seconds.

Injury Risk Consideration:
Proper technique and gradual loading are critical to reduce joint stress.

Nutrition Support:
- Adequate protein intake (1.8-2.2g/kg)
- Slight calorie surplus for strength gain
- Proper hydration and sodium balance
