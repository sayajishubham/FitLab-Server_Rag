CROSSFIT AND ENERGY SYSTEMS

CrossFit training improves work capacity across multiple energy systems.

Energy Systems:
1. ATP-PC system (short explosive efforts)
2. Glycolytic system (30 seconds to 2 minutes)
3. Oxidative system (long duration endurance)

CrossFit programming often mixes these systems in a single workout.

Workout Formats:
- AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible)
- EMOM (Every Minute On the Minute)
- For Time
- Chipper style workouts

Physiological Adaptations:
- Increased VO2 max
- Improved lactate threshold
- Enhanced muscular endurance
- Power output improvement

Movement Variety:
- Olympic lifts
- Gymnastics movements
- Conditioning cardio

Nutrition Strategy:
- Moderate to high carbohydrate intake
- Protein 1.6-2g/kg
- Electrolyte balance
- Adequate hydration
