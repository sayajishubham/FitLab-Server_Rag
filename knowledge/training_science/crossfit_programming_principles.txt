CROSSFIT PROGRAMMING PRINCIPLES

CrossFit is designed to improve general physical preparedness (GPP) across strength, endurance, power, agility, balance, and coordination.

Core Philosophy:
Constantly varied, high-intensity, functional movements.

Movement Categories:
1. Weightlifting (Olympic lifts, squats, presses)
2. Gymnastics (pull-ups, muscle-ups, handstands)
3. Monostructural cardio (rowing, running, cycling)

Energy System Emphasis:
- Short explosive workouts train ATP-PC system.
- Mid-length WODs (5-12 min) stress glycolytic system.
- Longer workouts (20+ min) challenge oxidative system.

Weekly Structure Example:
- Day 1: Heavy strength + short conditioning
- Day 2: Gymnastics skill + interval conditioning
- Day 3: Long endurance WOD
- Day 4: Olympic lifting focus
- Day 5: Mixed modal high intensity session

Volume Consideration:
Intensity is prioritized over volume.
Poor recovery management may increase injury risk.

Recovery Requirements:
- Adequate carbohydrate intake
- Electrolytes
- Sleep (7-9 hours)

Risk Management:
- Avoid excessive high-rep Olympic lifts under fatigue
- Maintain technique integrity
