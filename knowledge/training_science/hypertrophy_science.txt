HYPERTROPHY TRAINING SCIENCE

Hypertrophy refers to the increase in muscle fiber cross-sectional area. This adaptation occurs due to mechanical tension, metabolic stress, and muscle damage.

Primary Mechanisms:
1. Mechanical tension
2. Metabolic stress
3. Muscle fiber microtrauma

Effective Rep Ranges:
6-15 repetitions per set are optimal for hypertrophy when sets are taken close to muscular failure.

Rest Intervals:
30-90 seconds typically maximize metabolic stress while maintaining volume.

Training Volume:
Higher total weekly volume per muscle group (10-20 sets per muscle per week) correlates strongly with hypertrophy.

Frequency:
Training a muscle group 2 times per week is generally superior to once per week.

Tempo:
Controlled eccentric phase (2-3 seconds) improves time under tension.

Energy System:
Primarily glycolytic energy system due to moderate-duration efforts.

Nutrition Requirements:
- Protein: 1.6-2.2g per kg bodyweight
- Calorie surplus: 250-400 kcal per day for lean mass gain
- Carbohydrates important for glycogen replenishment

Recovery:
Muscle protein synthesis peaks within 24-48 hours post training.
Sleep and adequate calorie intake are critical.
