SHOULDER PAIN TRAINING MODIFICATIONS

Common Causes:
- Rotator cuff weakness
- Impingement syndrome
- Poor overhead mechanics
- Excessive pressing volume

Training Adjustments:
- Reduce overhead pressing temporarily
- Avoid wide-grip bench if painful
- Emphasize scapular stability exercises

Safe Alternatives:
- Neutral grip dumbbell press
- Landmine press
- Face pulls
- External rotation work

Programming Notes:
- Focus on pulling volume equal or greater than pushing
- Control eccentric tempo
- Avoid training to failure during pain phase

Mobility Focus:
- Thoracic spine mobility
- Posterior capsule stretching

Return to Overhead:
Gradually reintroduce overhead lifts after pain-free range improves.
