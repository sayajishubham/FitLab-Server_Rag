ELBOW PAIN GUIDELINES

Common Issues:
- Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis)
- Golfer’s elbow (medial epicondylitis)
- Overuse from excessive pulling or pressing

Training Adjustments:
- Reduce direct bicep/tricep isolation volume
- Avoid excessive grip strain
- Use straps for heavy pulling

Safe Alternatives:
- Neutral grip exercises
- Cable-based movements
- Slow tempo strengthening

Recovery:
- Isometric holds
- Gradual load progression
- Avoid high-rep failure sets during acute pain
