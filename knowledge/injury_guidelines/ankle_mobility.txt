ANKLE MOBILITY LIMITATIONS

Restricted ankle dorsiflexion affects squat depth and running efficiency.

Common Causes:
- Tight calves
- Previous ankle sprains
- Sedentary lifestyle

Training Adjustments:
- Elevate heels slightly during squats
- Use goblet squats
- Reduce depth temporarily

Mobility Drills:
- Calf stretching
- Banded ankle mobilizations
- Controlled knee-over-toe drills

Programming Consideration:
Limited ankle mobility may shift stress to knees or lower back.
Correct mobility before heavy loading.
