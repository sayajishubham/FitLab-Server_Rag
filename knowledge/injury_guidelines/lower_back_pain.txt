LOWER BACK PAIN GUIDELINES

Lower back pain may arise from:
- Poor hinge mechanics
- Weak core stabilizers
- Excessive spinal flexion under load

Training Adjustments:
- Neutral spine emphasis
- Avoid heavy spinal flexion
- Reduce axial loading temporarily

Safe Alternatives:
- Goblet squats
- Trap bar deadlifts
- Bird dogs
- McGill curl-ups
- Glute bridges

Core Stability:
- Focus on anti-extension exercises
- Anti-rotation training

Avoid:
- Heavy conventional deadlifts in acute phase
- High-rep fatigue-based spinal flexion

Progression:
Gradually reintroduce compound lifts after pain reduction.
